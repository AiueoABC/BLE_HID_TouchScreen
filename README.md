# BLE_HID_TouchScreen Emulation
This code works with "ESP WROOM-32 devKIT". Not sure for others. Once you connect your esp32, your device will recognize this esp32 as "HID-compliant touch screen".

I tested on my laptop, it works fine. With android, some are ok, some are not working.

# BLE_HID_TouchScreen Emulation (Multiple Touch)
This code works with "ESP WROOM-32 devKIT". Not sure for others. Once you connect your esp32, your device will recognize this esp32 as "HID-compliant touch screen".

With android, some are ok, some are not working. Multiple touch is available on Android, but not working with Windows10.
